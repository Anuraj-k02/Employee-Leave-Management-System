We tried creating the Employee Leave System which provides amazing feature for the user. We 
created different modules for different use so that each section is separated properly. There are two 
panel one for employee and one for Admin. Employee can create their own profile and apply for the 
leave and the higher authorities can accept or decline using their own profile.
